ðŸŽ¯ Consensus Mechanism Simulation Summary
I've created a comprehensive consensus mechanism simulation that demonstrates Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) with the following features:
ðŸ”§ Key Components
Mock Validators:

PoW Miners: Hash power (50-200 MH/s), electricity costs
PoS Stakers: Stake amounts (10K-50K tokens), staking age
DPoS Delegates: Vote counts, reputation scores (70-95/100)

ðŸŽ® Simulation Logic
Proof of Work:

Miners compete with computational power
Winner selected by highest hash attempts
High energy consumption, high security

Proof of Stake:

Weighted random selection based on stake
Includes stake age bonuses
Low energy, economic incentives

Delegated Proof of Stake:

Token holders vote for delegates
Winner has most votes
Democratic selection, very low energy

ðŸ“Š Educational Features
Interactive Modes:

Run individual consensus mechanisms
Compare all three side-by-side
Multi-round simulations showing variation
Real-time validator statistics

Detailed Explanations:

Selection logic for each mechanism
Energy consumption comparisons
Security trade-offs
Real-world examples (Bitcoin, Ethereum 2.0, EOS)
